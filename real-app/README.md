This folder contains the code of a reasonably real application 
implemented in the language.

**Description**: The application reads in a .csv file containing tuition fees of Undergraduate and Graduate level for Canadian and International students from 2006/2007 to 2018/2019. The user would choose which province tuition fees trend they would like to see by typing in the name of said province. The application would then plot by tuition (Y - axis) and academic school year (X - asis), per level of study (Canadian Undergrad and grad, International Undergrad and grad).
