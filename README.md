## About the language

**Description**: Scala is a general purpose programming language. It is also supports Functional programming, Object oriented programming, Imperative programming and Concurrent computing. Scala itself is a strong static system, designed to address Java's problems. 

**History**: Publicly released on January 20, 2004. Scala was first designed in 2001 by Martin Odersky, co-creator of javac and Java Generic, at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Lausanne, Switzerland. Scala design decisions and conceptions was to be multi paradigm, focused on the JVM and to overcome the problems left by other languages. 


> - If I were to pick a language to use today other than Java, it would be Scala. – James Gosling, creator of Java
> - If someone had shown me the ‘Programming in Scala’ book back in 2003, I’d probably have never created Groovy – James Strachan, creator of Groovy
> - No other language on the JVM seems as capable of being ‘replacement of Java’ as Scala, and the momentum behind Scala is now unquestionable – Charles Nutter , co-creator of JRuby

**Snippets** (Interesting features about Scala):
1. Scala can import libraries anywhere in the code, unlike Java import statements only being at the top.
2. Scala does not have any operators.
3. Methods can have multiple parameter lists.
4. In Scala, it is possible to define methods in methods.
5. Variable declare types are put after the variable names.

      y 20]
  (+ x y))
```
